# Project 1: Non-Transitive Systems, Monte Carlo Algorithms, and Gamma Distribution Simulation

## Overview

This project analyzes non-transitive systems using non-transitive dice, Monte Carlo simulations, and Gamma distribution modeling. It implements functions to compare dice outcomes, verify non-transitive properties, and explore probabilistic behaviors in complex systems.

## Introduction

Non-transitive systems, especially non-transitive dice, exhibit counterintuitive properties where one object may outperform another in a non-predictable manner. This project simulates and analyzes these systems using Monte Carlo methods and includes a Gamma distribution simulation for advanced probabilistic modeling.

## Features

- **Duelo Function**: Compares two dice and determines the winner based on the majority of outcomes.
- **Notransitivo Function**: Checks if a set of three dice exhibits non-transitive properties.
- **Gamma Distribution Simulation**: Simulates a random variable with a Gamma distribution.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Uses Monte Carlo methods to analyze the outcomes and behaviors of non-transitive systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project1-nontransitive-systems.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project1-nontransitive-systems

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash 
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   
## Usage

To run the simulations and analyses, open the `Proyecto1.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in sequence. The notebook contains all the necessary code, including the functions `Duelo` and `Notransitivo`, and additional code for the Gamma distribution simulation.
